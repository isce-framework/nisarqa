### Wrapped Phase and Wrapped Coherence Magnitude (RIFG, GUNW)

Note: Input GUNW products contain individual coherence magnitude layers for the unwrapped phase image and for the wrapped phase image, at postings matching the corresponding phase image. Both coherence magnitude layers are plotted in the GUNW QA report.

### Cross Offset Variance and Correlation Surface Peak (RIFG, RUNW, GUNW, ROFF, GOFF)

Cross Offset Variance is only available in ROFF and GOFF products. Correlation Surface Peak is available in all RIFG, RUNW, GUNW, ROFF, GOFF products.

### HSI Image (RIFG, RUNW, GUNW)

For RIFG products, the Hue, Saturation, Intensity (HSI) image is constructed from the wrapped phase raster and the wrapped coherence magnitude raster.

For GUNW and RUNW products, the HSI image is constructed from the unwrapped phase raster 
and the unwrapped coherence magnitude raster.

### HSI Image (RIFG, RUNW, GUNW)

For RIFG products, the Hue, Saturation, Intensity (HSI) image is constructed from the wrapped phase raster and the wrapped coherence magnitude raster.

For GUNW and RUNW products, the HSI image is constructed from the unwrapped phase raster 
and the unwrapped coherence magnitude raster.

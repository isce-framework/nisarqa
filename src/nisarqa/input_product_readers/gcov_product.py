        Notes
        -----
        Unlike RSLC products, the polarizations contained within a GCOV product
        do not map to the NISAR mode table. For GCOV, The user selects a subset
        of polarizations of the RSLC to process. With that subset, the GCOV
        SAS workflow verifies if it should symmetrize the cross-polarimetric
        channels (HV and VH) into a single cross-polarimetric channel (HV),
        and also verifies if it should generate the full covariance or only
        the diagonal terms.
        Usually polarimetric symmetrization is applied; symmetrization
        joins HV and VH into a single polarimetric channel HV.
        Layer selection for LSAR GCOV Browse:
        - Frequency A is used if available. Otherwise, Frequency B.
        - If only one polarization is available, or if the images are cross-pol,
        make one layer into grayscale. This function selects that layer.
        - Otherwise, generate an RGB color composition, per the algorithm
        described in `save_gcov_browse_img()`. This function will gather the
        largest subset of: {HHHH, VVVV, (HVHV or VHVH)}, in prep for that
        function.
        GCOV and RTC-S1 pixels are square on the ground, so the multilooking
        factor is the same in both directions, depending only in the expected
        output dimensions.

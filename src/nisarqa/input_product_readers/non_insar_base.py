        Get the path to the RFI likelihood h5py Dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        freq : {'A', 'B'}
            The frequency sub-band. Must be a valid sub-band in the product.
        pol : str
            The desired polarization, e.g. "HH" or "HV".
            Warning: For GCOV, this should be a polarization (e.g. "HH"), and
            not a GCOV term (e.g. "HHHH"). The list of available polarizations
            in the input product can be accessed via the product reader's
            `nisarqa.NisarProduct.get_list_of_polarizations()` method.

        Returns
        -------
        rfi_likelihood_path : str
            The path to the radio frequency interference (RFI) likelihood
            Dataset for the given freq and pol.

        Warnings
        --------
        `rfiLikelihood` was added in ISCE3 v0.17.0 for R3.4.1.
        Unfortunately, that release does not correspond directly to product
        specification version number. Product Specification v1.1.0 and later
        should have this dataset, but it's messy to algorithmically
        handle the products generated prior to that. The returned
        `rfi_likelihood_path` will be correct for products generated with
        ISCE3 v0.17.0 and later, but might not exist in earlier test datasets.
        The calling function should handle this case accordingly.

        Notes
        -----
        Typically, QA returns the Dataset's actual values, and not a path
        to an h5py.Dataset. However, this Dataset is only being used by
        `copy_rfi_metadata_to_stats_h5()`, which needs to wholesale copy
        the Dataset and its Attributes. By returning just the path, then
        any new Attributes in subsequent ISCE3 releases will be automatically
        get copied as well.

        group, but this cannot be guaranteed, or the nes0 data might follow
        an entirely different specification structure.
        ISCE3 products generated for R4.0.4 or later with product specification
        version >=1.2.0 should contain an equivalent group called
        `noiseEquivalentBackscatter`. (For R4.0.4, `nes0` was renamed.)
        Unfortunately, the official ISCE3 releases do not perfectly align
        with updates to the product specification version, so some products
        will have out-of-sync product spec version numbers and dataset names.

        For simplicity, QA should only support data products with the
        newer NEB structure (>= ISCE3 R4).
